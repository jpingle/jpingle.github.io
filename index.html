            Introduction:
          </h6>
          <h6 style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; line-height: 1.5em; font-weight:normal; margin-top:-1em;">
            Jonathan Pingle is a fourth-year undergraduate at Columbia University
            double majoring in Economics-Political Science and History.
            In history, he concentrates on Soviet foreign policy towards
            the Middle East but  -quite sincerely- finds everything interesting.
            He has worked at the International Rescue Committee, the Institute
            of International Finance, and Caritas Lebanon. He finds writing
            this introduction in the third-person exceedingly uncomfortable
            and hopes that the viewer will forgive him for unfortunately stumbling
            across it. For more on Jonathan please go to the about page.

            Note from the Author:
          </h6>
          <h6 style="font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif; line-height: 1.5em; font-weight:normal; margin-top:-1em;">
            This website here serves a few purposes. First, the Libary page is
            a collection of papers, articles, blog posts, or measly rants that
            I wish to share. Second, the site itself (thanks to GitHub) is a
            free place for me to play around with some of the projects that I
            will eventually make easily accessible. Lastly, the
            website serves as an ugly form of self-promotion- only made easier
            to bear by the knowledge that it is not highly publicized. Anyway,
            please look around, explore, play, modify, and generally do as you
            wish. The source is all public on my GitHub which is linked in the
            contact section. I apologize for any further distress this may
            cause and wish you an interesting time or a somewhat
            fulfilling experience.
